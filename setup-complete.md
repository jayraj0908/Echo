2. **Command Interface**: 
   - `*/help` - Show available commands and agents
   - `*/agent [name]` - Switch to specialized agent
   - `*/status` - Show current agent and context

3. **Enhanced Conversations**:
   - Every chat enhanced with BMad-Method context
   - Agent-specific expertise applied to responses
   - Structured workflows and methodologies available

## Next Steps

1. **Set your API key** in `.env`:
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
